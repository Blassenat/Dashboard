Dashboard Project (HENNGE One Inspired)
üöÄ Project Overview

This is a personal project inspired by HENNGE One, aiming to create a mini SaaS platform for access management and security dashboards.
It is built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Pinia for state management.

The project currently supports:

User authentication (login with JWT tokens)

Role-based access control (User / Admin)

A dashboard showing mock security and usage statistics

Simulated Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) flow

The goal is to demonstrate frontend architecture, state management, and security-focused UI similar to enterprise SaaS applications.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Frontend: Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite

State Management: Pinia

Routing: Vue Router

Testing: Vitest

Linting: ESLint / Prettier

Charts / Dashboard: (to be added, e.g., Chart.js, ApexCharts)

üéØ Features
For Users

Login with JWT token

Dashboard with personal connection history and MFA status

Profile page to manage security settings (change password, toggle MFA)

For Admins

Dashboard showing organization-wide stats:

Active users over 30 days

Successful / failed login attempts

MFA adoption rate

User management (mocked): activate/deactivate users, enforce MFA

Audit logs (mocked): track login attempts, device usage

Upcoming Features
